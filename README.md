# Classification_Model
**Project Description: Classification Algorithms**

**Project Overview:**
The "Classification Algorithms" project focuses on the exploration and implementation of various classification algorithms using Python. Through Jupyter Notebook, the project provides an interactive environment for data analysis, model development, and performance evaluation.

**Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of different classification algorithms in solving real-world problems. By leveraging a dataset from HR employee data, the project aims to predict employee attrition and explore factors contributing to it.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Exploration:** Thorough exploration of the HR employee dataset to uncover insights and patterns relevant to employee attrition.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset to prepare it for model training and evaluation.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation of each algorithm's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Utilization of Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis, code execution, and visualization.
